# Many-faced honeypot
Socket-based python web(and more) honeypot.
Goal of the project is to explore world of internet crawlers.

```
usage: mfh.py [-h] [-c [PORT]] [-s [PORT]] [-u] [-v]

Serve some sweet honey to the ubiquitous bots!

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -c [PORT]      port to start a CLIENT on
  -s [PORT]      port to start a SERVER on
  -u             enable self updating
  -v, --verbose  increase output verbosity

And that`s how you`d detect a sneaky chinese bot.
```
